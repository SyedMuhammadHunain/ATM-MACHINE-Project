-----------ATM-MACHINE-project------------  

I've build an ATM MACHINE using the very basics of C LANGUAGE, which allows you to deposit money and withdraw money from the machine at the same time. After withdrawl the money will be deducted from the total balance which you have deposited.

---------------FEATURES------------
* PIN verification
* Deposite amount
* Withdraw amount
* Withdrawl amount must be upto 5000
* At the end, it will display you Balance, and withdrawl amount(if any).
